### boshdeployment.yaml 

A basic use-case where the operator takes in the BOSH manifest and ops files to spawn the required pods in Kubernetes according to the configuration in the BOSH manifest file.

### boshdeployment-with-custom-variable.yaml

This has an extra secret generated by the operator to be used as a NATS password, instead of providing it as a variable.
